# Insomnia
Inspired from `caffeinate` to keep system from falling asleep

Supported: 
- `windows`
- `macos` (version >= 10.15)
- `linux` (with `dbus`)


## Why? 
When you jump from distro to distro in linux and often hop between MacOS/Windows it becomes annoying to find a particular setting to toggle just to keep the system awake. I made `insomnia` to solve this problem.
